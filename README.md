# 🤖 CLAT 2025 Chatbot - NLP-Powered FAQ Assistant

This is a simple **NLP-based chatbot** built using `Streamlit` and `SentenceTransformers` that helps users ask questions about the **CLAT 2025 exam** and get accurate, context-aware answers. Instead of relying on keyword matching, it uses **semantic similarity** to understand the intent of the user's question and find the most relevant answer from a curated knowledge base.

---

## 🧠 Powered By

- `SentenceTransformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for semantic embeddings
- `PyTorch Cosine Similarity` for matching query with closest Q&A
- `Streamlit` for a clean and interactive web app interface

---

## 📁 Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is stored in `clat_kb.json`, and contains 25+ Q&A pairs based on:
- CLAT 2025 syllabus and exam format
- Section-wise breakdown (English, Legal Reasoning, etc.)
- Marking scheme and preparation tips
- Official materials shared by the CLAT Consortium

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install streamlit sentence-transformers
```

2. **Run the chatbot**:
```bash
streamlit run chat.py
```

3. **Ask anything like**:
- "What is the syllabus of CLAT 2025?"
- "How many questions in Legal Reasoning?"
- "What is the exam duration?"

## 🤖 How It Works

- All KB questions are embedded using `SentenceTransformer`.
- When a user types a query, it’s also embedded.
- Cosine similarity is calculated between the user query and all KB entries.
- The answer corresponding to the highest similarity score is returned.

This allows the chatbot to understand the **meaning** of the question, not just keywords.

## 🔄 Sample Architecture

```
User Query
   ⬇
SentenceTransformer → Embedding
   ⬇
Cosine Similarity (query vs KB)
   ⬇
Most Similar Q → Return Corresponding Answer
```

## 🧠 Bonus: Scaling to GPT-Based RAG System

To build a more intelligent and scalable version:

### 🔧 Tech Stack Suggestion:

- **Embedding**: Google Generative AI, OpenAI, or HuggingFace Embedding APIs
- **Vector DB**: FAISS / ChromaDB to store large-scale Q&A and documents
- **Retriever**: LangChain or custom retriever for top-k documents
- **LLM (Answer Generator)**: Gemini Pro, GPT-4, Claude, or Mistral
- **Frontend**: Streamlit / React with chat UI

### 📌 Architecture:

```
User Query
   ⬇
Embed with LLM → Vector DB → Retrieve Top-k Docs
   ⬇
Prompt + Retrieved Context → LLM → Answer
   ⬇
Display in UI
```

This makes the system truly conversational, able to handle more complex and unstructured questions with dynamic context injection.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add fuzzy keyword fallback (rule + NLP hybrid)
- Store conversation history in session state
- Convert to an API endpoint for deployment on web
- Integrate with CLAT preparation platforms as a chatbot widget
